## Permissive Licenses
Permissive licenses generally allow for use of the licensed code with few restrictions. Users can take the permissive-licensed software, make it their own through changes or additions, and distribute that modified program with only a handful of conditions.

## Copyleft Licenses
In contrast to permissive licenses, copyleft licenses generally require that any derivative work of the copyleft-licensed software be released under the same license as the original. In other words, the modified code has to be exactly as “open” as the original.


# Popular Permissive Software Licenses
## MIT License
The MIT License is one of the most commonly used and permissive open source licenses. Under this license, you can essentially do anything with the software as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in the copy of the software. It is also compatible with many copyleft licenses, including the GPLs.

## Apache License 2.0
The Apache License 2.0 is another commonly used permissive open source license. With this license, you have the freedom to do what you want with the software, with the exception that you must include the original copyright and license notice, state any significant changes, and include the NOTICE file if there is one. It's also important to note that while the Apache License 2.0 is compatible with GPL v3, it is not compatible with GPL v2.

## BSD License
The BSD License, short for Berkeley Software Distribution, allows the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software as long as the copyright notice and license text are included in the copy of the software. There are several different variants of this license; the difference between these versions is the number of clauses, or restrictions, included. The BSD 3-Clause License (also known as the "New BSD License" or "Modified BSD License") is the most popular variant. The BSD 3-Clause is very similar to the MIT Licenses, with the key exception of the BSD 3’s non-endorsement clause, which prohibits distributed derivative works from using the name of the original code's author or contributors for promotional

# Popular Copyleft Software Licenses
## GPL License
The GNU General Public License family, or GPL for short, includes two of the most commonly used copyleft licenses: GPL v2 and GPL v3. (GPL v1 is no longer widely used.) The GPL License states that if you write and distribute a program using a GPL-licensed component, you must also release the full source code while giving your users the same rights you received. This license was created to protect software from becoming proprietary, or private, which is why many programmers like this license. They get the assurance that the restrictions with the GPL License will keep their work free and acknowledged.

## Mozilla Public License 2.0
The Mozilla Public License 2.0, also known as MPL 2.0, is a weak copyleft license maintained by the Mozilla Foundation. If a distributed program modifies code licensed under MPL 2.0, those modifications must also be licensed under MPL 2.0 and made available in source code form. However, if a distributed program simply uses (as opposed to modifies) MPL 2.0-licensed code and keeps it in separate files, they can combine that code with non-MPL code to create a larger work.
